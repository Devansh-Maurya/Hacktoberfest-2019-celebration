	<h1>Hi everyone, my name is Celia!</h1>
	<p>I'm from Lima, Per√∫, but living in Buenos Aires, Argentina actually. I started learning Java last year, I was my first touch with code...and catches me. (Sorry for my intermediate english!)</p>
    <p>Then, I won a studentship for a FullStack Development Bootcamp. That was pretty awesome! I was very happy when I knew it (also now), and finally, made it. I did the whole challenge.
    I wasn't easy, I worked hard, but what I learned...was exponential.</p>
    <p>Front End, Back End, Frameworks, languages, Agile/Scrum, mentors, new friends, auto-knowing, falling in love, get inspired, etc. This year was totaly amazing.</p>
    <p>After several job interviews, I got my first job. And I'll just start this tuesday! I'm so grateful for everything and everyone. At least, many friends got their first job too! Fun fact: They work near me :D</p>
    <p>And yeah, I'll start a new stage in my life, but I want that more people can start or change their job careers, because I believe that, seriously, can change lives. My goal is to help people make it or at least, cheer them.</p>
    <p>You can follow me and see what I am doing! Greetings from the heart, Celia.</p>
